# 🪣 AWS S3 — Simple Guide

## 1️⃣ What is Amazon S3?

Amazon **Simple Storage Service (S3)** is a **cloud storage service** by AWS that lets you **store and retrieve unlimited data** from anywhere on the internet.  
It’s secure, scalable, and cost-effective.

---

## 2️⃣ S3 Buckets — Core Concept

- A **bucket** is like a **top-level folder** where you store files (called *objects*).  
- Each bucket has a **globally unique name**.  
- Buckets are created in a specific **AWS region**.

### ✅ Why use S3 Buckets
- **Durability & Availability** (99.999999999% durability)  
- **Scalability** — store any amount of data  
- **Security** — encryption + access control  
- **High Performance**  
- **Cost-effective** storage options

---

## 3️⃣ Creating & Configuring Buckets

### 📝 Steps to Create a Bucket
1. Go to **AWS Console → S3 → Create Bucket**
2. Choose a **unique bucket name**
3. Select a **region**
4. Configure properties like versioning, encryption, and permissions
5. Create the bucket ✅

### ⚙️ Bucket Properties
- **Versioning** → Keep multiple versions of objects (protect from accidental deletions)
- **Access Control** → Manage who can read/write
- **Encryption** → Secure your data at rest
- **Bucket Policies** → Define permissions using JSON

---

## 4️⃣ Uploading & Managing Objects

### 📤 Upload Methods
- AWS Management Console  
- AWS CLI  
- AWS SDKs / APIs  
- HTTP Direct Uploads

Each object has a **key** (its path/name in the bucket).

### 📝 Object Metadata
Stores extra info like:
- Content type  
- Cache control  
- Encryption type  
- Custom tags

### 🔐 Encryption Options
- **SSE-S3** – Amazon-managed keys  
- **SSE-KMS** – AWS KMS-managed keys (more control)  
- **SSE-C** – Customer-provided keys

### 🧰 Additional Features
- **Lifecycle Management** → Move or delete objects based on rules  
- **Multipart Uploads** → Upload large files in parts for speed & reliability  
- **S3 Batch Operations** → Perform bulk actions (copy/tag/delete) on millions of objects

---

## 5️⃣ Advanced Bucket Features

### 📦 Storage Classes
Different cost & performance tiers:
- **Standard** – Frequently accessed data  
- **Intelligent-Tiering** – Auto tiering to save cost  
- **Standard-IA / One Zone-IA** – Infrequent access  
- **Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive** – Long-term archiving

### 🌐 Replication
- **CRR (Cross-Region Replication)** → Copy data to another region (disaster recovery)
- **SRR (Same-Region Replication)** → Copy data within the same region (low latency, compliance)

### 🔔 Event Notifications
Trigger actions when:
- Object is created  
- Object is deleted  
- Prefix or suffix matches  

Examples:
- Trigger AWS Lambda functions  
- Send messages to SQS or SNS

---

## 6️⃣ Security & Compliance

### 🔒 Access Control
- Use **Bucket Policies**, **IAM Policies**, and **ACLs** to control access
- Follow **least privilege** principle

### 🧰 Encryption
- **At Rest** → SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C  
- **In Transit** → HTTPS (SSL/TLS)

### 📊 Logging & Monitoring
- **Access Logs** → Detailed logs of bucket activity  
- **CloudTrail** → Records API calls  
- **CloudWatch** → Monitor S3 metrics and set alarms

---

## 7️⃣ Management & Administration

- **Bucket Policies** → JSON rules defining who can do what  
- **IAM Roles** → Temporary, controlled access  
- **APIs & SDKs** → Programmatic operations (upload, list, delete)

### 🧰 Tools
- **AWS Console** (UI)  
- **AWS CLI** (Command Line)  
- **SDKs / Third-party tools**

## 8️⃣ Troubleshooting

### ⚠️ Common Errors
| Error              | Reason / Fix                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| AccessDenied        | Check IAM/bucket policy                          |
| NoSuchBucket        | Bucket doesn’t exist or wrong name               |
| QuotaExceeded       | Exceeded S3 limits (very rare)                   |

### 🧪 Debugging Access Issues
- Check **IAM policy**, **bucket policy**, and **public access settings**
- Use **CloudTrail** and **Access Logs** to trace issues

### 🗂 Data Consistency & Recovery
- S3 provides **strong consistency**
- Use **Versioning** to restore deleted or overwritten objects
- Use **Replication** for disaster recovery
